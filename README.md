Web page editor for RT. 
This project was made in terms of the "Digital Breakthrough 2021" hackathon. 
Our team took 8th place :(
You can check out our project in web: rt-editor.netlify.app

In order to launch our application locally you should firstly install Docker, then clone that repo and cd to it.
Eventually, type in docker-compose up, wait a bit and visit localhost:3000.
